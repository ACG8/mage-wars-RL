current: reformat the spell and item system and let player start with spell training (chosen at startup). The plan:
	- scrolls can be used either to cast the spell for free, or to study the spell.
	- once you study a spell enough, you learn to cast it by paying its cost
	- the number of times you have to study a spell is equal to its level times your training in that school (1 being trained, 3 being antitrained).

	- for items (controls, really), 'i' opens up the inventory, you select an object, and then select a use option.

next: integrate equipment that can be put on more than one slot or on multiple slots.

next : allow creatures to eat corpses? Of course, the ghoul does this... hmmm...
