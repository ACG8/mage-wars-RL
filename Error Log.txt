Note: this error is difficult to reproduce. Not sure what conditions are.

If you cancel/have error while autoplaying you get an error upon continuing

Error in loading where some items are not on object list.

Allow item stacking (perhaps only for items, not equipment). Use same system as spell stacking. Might want to define a function for this.

For future: when implementing status removal, make sure that removing tainted also removes damage from taint.

Long term - need to reform attacking time so that it is a property of each attack. In general, need to move away from hardcoding action times.

When a corpse dies, its remains can burn. Should probably remove all conditions upon death.

Zone attack area highlighting persists after the attack has been made. Probably a problem with the targeting function.

Next: improve taming system.
