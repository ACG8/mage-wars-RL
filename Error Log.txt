current: reformat the spell and item system and let player start with spell training (chosen at startup). The plan:
	- scrolls can be used either to cast the spell for free, or to study the spell.
	- once you study a spell enough, you learn to cast it by paying its cost
	- the number of times you have to study a spell is equal to its level times your training in that school (1 being trained, 3 being antitrained).

	- for items (controls, really), 'i' opens up the inventory, you select an object, and then select a use option.

next: integrate equipment that can be put on more than one slot or on multiple slots.

currently : add friendly creatures, improve ability to move around/through allies

Major structural rewrite - we need a way to store every object in a tile so that they can be retrieved without iteration. This can be implemented in the move and creation functions. Basically, each tile has a set of objects. When you move, you are removed from the previous tile and added to the next. This is somewhat clumsy, but I don't think there should be any problems as long as this is consistent. Ideally, I want to reference this change as little as possible. I must be alert for bugs caused by something being in two tiles.

Once this change is implemented, I can go through the code and replace iteration with simply checking the tile's list of objects. Should be much faster.
